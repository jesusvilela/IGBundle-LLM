echo "⚠️  NOTE: This is a framework script."
echo "📝 Actual implementation requires:"
echo "   1. Running baseline configuration: lora_only"
echo "   2. Running comparison configurations:"

echo "      1. full_geometric"

echo "   3. Collecting results and running analysis"
echo ""
echo "🔧 To implement:"
echo "   1. Create configuration files for each variant"
echo "   2. Run training for each configuration"
echo "   3. Use: python comparative_studies.py run_study --study geometric_vs_lora"

echo "✅ Comparative study framework ready: geometric_vs_lora"
