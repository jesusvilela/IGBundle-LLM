echo "⚠️  NOTE: This is a framework script."
echo "📝 Actual implementation requires:"
echo "   1. Running baseline configuration: equal_learning_rates"
echo "   2. Running comparison configurations:"

echo "      1. ratio_1_to_2"
echo "      2. ratio_1_to_5"
echo "      3. ratio_1_to_10"
echo "      4. ratio_1_to_20"
echo "      5. ratio_1_to_50"

echo "   3. Collecting results and running analysis"
echo ""
echo "🔧 To implement:"
echo "   1. Create configuration files for each variant"
echo "   2. Run training for each configuration"
echo "   3. Use: python comparative_studies.py run_study --study learning_rate_ratio_study"

echo "✅ Comparative study framework ready: learning_rate_ratio_study"
