The input grid has 10 columns and 10 rows.\n2. The transformation rules are applied to each cell in the grid.\n3. The output grid is generated by applying the transformation rules to the input grid.\n4. The output grid has the same shape as the input grid.\n5. The output grid has the same values as the input grid, except for the cells that are transformed.\n6. The output grid is verified to respect all constraints, including the grid shape and the grid values.\n7. The output grid is generated by applying the transformation rules to the input grid, and the output grid is verified to respect all constraints."
