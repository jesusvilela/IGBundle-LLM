# Roast: Actor–Critic Swarm Feedback

Below is a candid, high-signal roast designed to tighten the workflow and elevate scientific rigor. It uses an **actor–critic** loop and a **swarm** of specialized reviewers. Treat this as the shortest path from “ambitious draft” to “publishable thesis.”

## 🎭 Actor–Critic Loop

### **Actor (Builder)**
You promised a unified, rigorously scientific document with rich graphs and data. You delivered a patchwork of PDFs and logs that look like they were stitched together during a caffeine crash. A true thesis should read like a single mind wrote it, not a committee of scripts arguing in a /tmp folder.

**Actionable fixes (actor):**
1. **Unify narrative voice**: Make sections read in one continuous voice (same tense, same terminology).
2. **Merge methodologies**: Eliminate duplicate method descriptions; present one authoritative method section.
3. **Normalize figures**: Consistent style, captions, and numbering across all graphs.
4. **Reconcile metrics**: Centralize evaluation metrics in one master table.
5. **Version hygiene**: Consolidate PDFs into one source-of-truth markdown/latex before compiling.

### **Critic (Verifier)**
Your “rigorous” claims are undercut by missing citations, inconsistent notation, and charts without error bars. Some graphs are visually rich but scientifically thin. You’re one skeptical reviewer away from a desk reject.

**Actionable fixes (critic):**
1. **Add statistical validity**: confidence intervals, error bars, and significance tests.
2. **Standardize notation**: define symbols once, enforce globally.
3. **Check data provenance**: every figure needs a traceable data source.
4. **Reproducibility pass**: each result must map to a script or command.
5. **Citation sweep**: remove orphan claims; add sources for all non-trivial assertions.

## 🐝 Swarm-Based Reviewer Roles (Peer Review + Pre-Publish)

### 1) **Methodology Auditor**
- **Roast**: Your methods section feels like a choose-your-own-adventure. Pick one path and stick to it.
- **Checklist**:
  - Method section is single, definitive, and self-contained.
  - All hyperparameters are listed in a dedicated table.

### 2) **Statistical Rigor Reviewer**
- **Roast**: A plot without variance is just art.
- **Checklist**:
  - Every plot includes variance (CI/SE) and sample size.
  - Add statistical tests where claims compare models.

### 3) **Results Integrity Reviewer**
- **Roast**: Some results look cherry-picked. Show the full distribution, not just best-case.
- **Checklist**:
  - Include aggregate + per-task breakdowns.
  - Add ablation summary with consistent metric definitions.

### 4) **Narrative Cohesion Editor**
- **Roast**: Sections read like different authors who never met.
- **Checklist**:
  - One voice, one glossary, one glossary source.
  - Reduce repetitive intro text across chapters.

### 5) **Visualization Critic**
- **Roast**: Half your graphs have cosmetic flair but weak labeling.
- **Checklist**:
  - Ensure axis units, legends, and captions are explicit.
  - Align typography, color palette, and plot layout across figures.

### 6) **Reproducibility Sheriff**
- **Roast**: If I can’t run it, it didn’t happen.
- **Checklist**:
  - Add a “Reproduce Results” section with commands.
  - Tie each figure to a script + data file path.

## ✅ Pre-Publish Checklist (Minimal Gate)

- [ ] One master source file builds the entire thesis.
- [ ] All metrics and figures trace to a data file + script.
- [ ] All claims have citations or empirical backing.
- [ ] Methods are consistent and centralized.
- [ ] Statistical validity is explicit in every result.

## Final Verdict
You’re trying to ship a Ferrari made from spare parts and duct tape. The idea is strong, but the execution is scattered. Consolidate, verify, and narrate like you want to survive peer review. Then you’ll actually have something publishable.
