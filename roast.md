# Roast v2: Actor–Critic Swarm After Claude’s “Progress”

Claude “worked in the meantime,” and the repo still reads like a lab notebook exploded across the filesystem. You asked for a single, rigorous thesis with rich graphs and data. What you have is a constellation of markdowns, scripts, and artifacts with no single spine. That’s not a thesis; it’s a scavenger hunt.

## 🎭 Actor–Critic Loop

### **Actor (Builder)**
You keep promising a coherent manuscript, then ship another pile of auxiliary files. The thesis needs to be *compiled from one authoritative source*, not stitched from a dozen drafts.

**Actionable fixes (actor):**
1. **Single source of truth**: designate one master thesis file and deprecate all parallel drafts.
2. **Figure registry**: create a canonical list of figures with script + data provenance.
3. **Versioned narrative**: enforce one voice, one tense, one glossary across all chapters.
4. **Graph consistency**: align typography, color palette, and caption format throughout.
5. **Evidence trail**: every result table maps to a reproducible command or script.

### **Critic (Verifier)**
Your “rigor” is still hiding behind vibes. There are claims without citations, plots without variance, and metrics without definitions. That’s not science; that’s marketing.

**Actionable fixes (critic):**
1. **Statistical validity**: error bars, confidence intervals, and tests wherever comparisons are made.
2. **Notation audit**: define symbols once and enforce globally.
3. **Result reproducibility**: each figure cites the script and input data used to generate it.
4. **Claim audit**: remove or source every non-trivial assertion.
5. **Scope discipline**: if a result is exploratory, label it as such.

## 🐝 Swarm Reviewers (Peer Review + Pre-Publish)

### 1) **Integration Lead**
- **Roast**: You built a thesis like a playlist with no tracklist.
- **Checklist**:
  - One master thesis source file compiles the final output.
  - All other drafts are archived or redirected.

### 2) **Methodology Gatekeeper**
- **Roast**: Your methods section still reads like a collage of experiments.
- **Checklist**:
  - Single, definitive method narrative.
  - Hyperparameters, data splits, and hardware spelled out in a table.

### 3) **Statistics Enforcer**
- **Roast**: If you can’t quantify uncertainty, you’re just guessing loudly.
- **Checklist**:
  - Include CI/SE and sample size for all core metrics.
  - Apply statistical tests for model comparisons.

### 4) **Results Integrity Marshal**
- **Roast**: You keep showing best-case highlights, not the full truth.
- **Checklist**:
  - Provide aggregate + per-task breakdowns.
  - Show ablations with consistent metric definitions.

### 5) **Visualization Auditor**
- **Roast**: Some plots look nice but explain nothing.
- **Checklist**:
  - Axes, units, legends, and captions are unambiguous.
  - Visual style is unified across all figures.

### 6) **Reproducibility Sheriff**
- **Roast**: If I can’t run it, it’s fiction.
- **Checklist**:
  - Include a “Reproduce Results” section with commands.
  - Every figure maps to a script + data file path.

## ✅ Minimal Gate Before You Pretend This Is a Thesis

- [ ] One master source file builds the entire thesis.
- [ ] Every figure/table traces to a script and data file.
- [ ] All claims are cited or empirically grounded.
- [ ] Methods are centralized and unambiguous.
- [ ] Statistical validity is explicit in every core result.

## Final Verdict
Claude may have “worked,” but you still don’t have a thesis—just artifacts orbiting one. Consolidate. Prove your claims. Standardize your visuals. Then and only then can you claim “rigorous.”
