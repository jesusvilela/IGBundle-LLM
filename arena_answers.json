    "answer": "Sure! Here's a Python function that uses recursion to find the nth Fibonacci number:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return \"Invalid input. n must be a positive integer.\"\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n```\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with the desired value of `n`:\n\n```python\nresult = fibonacci(n)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNote that this implementation has an exponential time complexity, so it may not be efficient for large values of `n`.",

Imagine you have a bag with holes in it, like a really big, stretchy net. Now, if you put sugar inside the bag and then put the bag in water, the sugar will move out of the bag and into the water. This is kind of like how osmosis works. The molecules of sugar move through the holes in the bag and into the water, and then they mix together. This is how plants and animals get water and nutrients from the soil and the air. It's like they're drinking through their skin!",
