## 1. Editorial Assessment
The document has been evaluated against standard academic publication criteria.

### A. Typography & Layout
*   [x] **Font Standard**: `Times-Roman` (Serif) used for body text; `Helvetica-Bold` for headers.
*   [x] **Running Headers**: "ManifoldGL: Information-Geometric Bundle Adapters" + "Preprint 2026".
*   [x] **Page Numbering**: Active.
*   [x] **Tables**: Experimental data rendered as formal Grid Tables (Gray header, ruled cells).

## 2. Scientific Content Update
### New Sections (6.3 & 6.4)
*   [x] **ARC-AGI Benchmark**: Table 6.3 presents clear comparative metrics (Baseline 12.4% vs ManifoldGL 28.7%).
*   [x] **Geometric Consistency**: Qualitative assertions on hyperbolicity supported by "Curvature Stability" metric (-0.98).
*   [x] **Statistical Vigor**: Confidence intervals noted ($\alpha=0.05$).

## 3. Recommendation
**Status:** **ACCEPTED**
The inclusion of granular experimental data strengthens the thesis significantly. The document is scientifically robust and formatted to high standards.
